The notebooks should be accessed using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook can be started through the Ananconda Navigator. This should open a browser window, allowing you to interact with the notebooks. 

Static HTML versions of the notebooks have been provided. These will allow you to review the material in environments where Jupyter Notebook cannot be run.
