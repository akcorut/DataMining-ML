    "Reading and Writing to a file can be fairly easy in Python. One opens a file using `open`, using one of the file **modes** `r`,`w`, or `a` to indicate whether you wish to open the file for reading, writing (overwriting any preexisting file contents), or appending (which simply adds new material to the end of a preexising file.  The mode `r+` allows both reading and writing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    myfile = open(\"text.txt\", w)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Above, the reference to the file object is assigned to `myfile`. The mode argument is optional. If none is specified, then `r` is assumed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By default, Python will open the file in **text mode**, which unsuprisingly is for reading and writing text. One benefit of text mode is that line endings are uniformly represented in strings as `\\n`, which avoids problems associated with the different encodings used by different operating systems (Windows, Unix, etc.). Python automatically handles the conversion to/from `\\n` to the platform-specific line ending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a **binary mode**, indicated by appending `b` to the mode argument, which is for reading and writing raw data (bytes). We generally won't deal with it, however. "
