    "*The following discusses a few points from Chapter 5 of Witten et al.'s **Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques** (4th ed).* Specifically, these notes discuss defining a confidence interval based on a classifier's performance on a dataset available (usually, data is scarce). They also discuss using statistical tests to evaluate the relative performance of classifiers. \n",

    "## Estimating classifier performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we develop a classification model, its performance (e.g., accuracy) will vary from data set to data set (even if the data sets were taken from the same population), and in general we'd like a way of estimating how well the model is expected to perform. One thing we can do is use the results obtained from a test set and define a confidence interval based on that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that applying the classifier to randomly selected data sets is a Bernouli process, like flipping a coin. If the probability of getting heads is $p$, then for any sequence of $N$ coin flips, the actual frequency of heads will be somewhere around $p$. If we were to record the values for multiple sequences of coin flips,  it turns out that the variance  of the values will be $p(1-p)/N$. For large $N$, the distribution will be approximately normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a classifier on a given set yields accuracy f=75%. To standardize $f$ (yielding a $z$ score), we would use the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{f - p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To define an interval, we would need to choose a suitable value for $z$ (based upon whatever confidence level we are interested in, and then compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(-z < \\frac{f - p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}} < +z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, what we are interested in is solving for $p$ (we treat the above as an equality and then solve for $p$). The details are omitted, but we are left with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$p = (f + \\frac{z^2}{2N} \\pm z\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{N}-\\frac{f^2}{N}+\\frac{z^2}{4N^2}})/(1+\\frac{z^2}{N})$\n",

Importantly, one should not use a standard paired t-test, as the this tends to falsely indicate that 2 models are different when they are not.
